# üè° FlameyEstates - Demo project

A realestate website, listing homes for purchase.
Using [DatoCMS](https://datocms.com) as a Headless CMS and [NuxtJS](https://nuxt.com/) for the frontend.
I opted for writing my own styles in SCSS, rather than using a framework.

More details to come..



## Build Setup

# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
