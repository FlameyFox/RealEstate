# FlameyEstates - Demo project üè°

A realestate platform listing homes for purchase, with a very slick and minimalistic design.

Using [DatoCMS](https://datocms.com) as a Headless CMS and [NuxtJS](https://nuxt.com/) for the frontend.
I opted for writing my own styles in SCSS, rather than using a framework.

Projecet is still under development and more details will come..



## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [documentation](https://nuxtjs.org).
