# FlameyEstates - Demo project 🏡

A realestate platform listing homes for purchase, with a very slick and minimalistic design.

Using [DatoCMS](https://datocms.com) as a Headless CMS and [NuxtJS](https://nuxt.com/) for the frontend.
I opted for writing my own styles in SCSS, rather than using a framework.
